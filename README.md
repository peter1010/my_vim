My Vim config

Since I have to use both Microsoft Windows & Linux and want to use the same VIM settings, I have structured the files as follows.

Remove the dot prefix from vim files to avoid the micosoft's poor handling of dot file and place all vim configuration files into a folder.

## On Windows:

Put the "\_vimrc" in the %HOME% directory. Sometimes %HOME% is on a remote share, so \_vimrc redefines HOME to be %USERPROFILE% which is local. \_vimrc then sets VIMFILES to be the folder vimfiles in the %USERPROFILE% folder.

Copy all files in the repo vimfiles folder into the vimfiles folder in %USERPROFILE% folder.

## On Linux:

Put the "\.vimrc" in the Home directory. It then sources the vimrc file in .vim folder.

Copy all files in the repo vimfiles folder into the .vim folder in Home.
